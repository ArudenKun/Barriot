## Code & Contribution

This project is mainly developed by me, with assistance of [Cenngo](https://github.com/Cenngo) in handling features like REST & interactions. If you have any interest in contributing, feel free to open a PR.

### 🎌 Code flags

- _**TODO**_
  - This flag should be investigated commonly for reflection on code and to revisit certain sections

```cs
// TODO,
// This is an example todo comment.
// Some other information.
```

- _**IN PROGRESS**_
  - This flag is used when marking progression on certain things but having to lay it off until further notice. Often marked for Discord.NET bugs that will be resolved.

```cs

``` 

### 🌿 Branch structure

- `unit/x` 
  - To unit test a feature.
- `fix/x` 
  - To fix an issue.
- `feature/x` 
  - To implement a new feature.
- `master` 
  - The main development branch, to which no direct commits are pushed outside of repo maintenance

### 📅 Version structure

`Major.Minor.Patch` as intended by ISO standard. Semantic versioning applies. 
Patches are often not incremented as minor version is already incremented before a patch is deployed due to the rapid development on features.

Version changes are made in the `.csproj` file, nowhere else. 
All occurences of versioning inside the code are grabbed from the project assembly, defined from `.csproj`.
